Write a one line function (give a name of your choice) with an implicit return that when the function is invoked, it will print: 'The first parameter is [parameter1]. The second parameter is [parameter2]'.

Write a function called 'greeting' that takes 3 parameters: firstName, lastName, and a callback function. In the function, invoke the callback, passing in a concatenation of firstName and lastName. 
Then, outside of the greeting function, invoke the greeting function, passing in the value firstName and lastName of your choice, and a callback function that takes a parameter of fullName. The callback function will print 'Hello, my full name is [fullName]'.

////////// PROBLEM 5 //////////

/* 
A function can return another function. Let's create one!

Create a function called 'multiplyingFactory' that takes a number as a param. The function returns another function that takes another number as a param. 

The inner function should run this logic: if the first number passing in is greater than and equal to 5, print the multiplication of the first and second numbers. If not, print "Cannot multiply: the first number is smaller than 5." 
*/

// CODE HERE


/* 
Let's invoke the 'multiplyingFactory' function that will return another function, and save it into a variable called 'timesFour.' Let's pass in number 3 as a param.
*/

// CODE HERE


/* 
Now, timesFour is the new function (the inner function that was being returned when we invoked 'multiplyingFactory' function). The number 3 that we passed in as a first number is now saved in the 'timesFour' function. 

Let's invoke 'timesFour' and pass in number 4 as a param. Number 4 here is the second number that will multiply the first number (number 3).

Run the code in node to see the printed result. You should see "Cannot multiply: the first number is smaller than 5."
*/

// INVOKE 'timesFour' HERE


/* 
Change the param for 'multiplyingFactory' invocation to number 5. Then invoke 'timesFour' again, passing in number 4. Run the code in node, and you should see 20.
